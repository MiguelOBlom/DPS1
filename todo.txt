TODO:
Describe remaining experiments in 'identification.txt'


Use stuff from lecture 3:
Plot experiments over multiple runs -> Check if normal distribution

Use this from Lecture 3:
Composed  of multiple parts:
1. Designing the prototype.  
2. Building the prototype
3. Assuring the prototype runs correctly (testing)
4. Deploying in relevant conditions/environment
5. Running relevant applications and scenarios
6. Checking the results are statistically 
significant/sound







[ ] Get Giraph, Graphx and GraphLab
[ ] Deploy on DAS-5
[ ] Use the PageRank and Connected Component algorithms as described in the paper
[X] Collect datasets
[ ] Describe experiment
	- Infrastructure
	- Number of machines, nodes, repetitions
	- Can we use average? (Statistical method)
[ ] Run experiments
