TODO:
Describe remaining experiments in 'identification.txt'


Use stuff from lecture 3:
Plot experiments over multiple runs -> Check if normal distribution

Use this from Lecture 3:
Composed  of multiple parts:
1. Designing the prototype.  
2. Building the prototype
3. Assuring the prototype runs correctly (testing)
4. Deploying in relevant conditions/environment
5. Running relevant applications and scenarios
6. Checking the results are statistically 
significant/sound
